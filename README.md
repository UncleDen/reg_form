Hi!
I doed registration form wich validation.
i use redbeanphp to work wich db.
To send form i use Ajax.
I doed simple validation on js and php.
I have problem wuch redirect to success page ,but in success page when user register you can see "Welcome <email>"
i tryed to do this task very fast and maybe forget something.
So that the form works you just need to connect it to db in db.php
i think i spended to this task a 1.30 or 2 hours
