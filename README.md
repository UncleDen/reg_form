Hi!
I did registration form wich validation.
i use RedBeanPHP to work wich db.
To send form i use Ajax.
I did simple validation on js and php.
I have problem with redirect to success page ,but in success page, when user registered you can see "Welcome <email>"
i tried to do this task very fast and maybe forgot something.
So that the form works you just need to connect it to db in db.php
i think i spent to this task a 1.30 or 2 hours
